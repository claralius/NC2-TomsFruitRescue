# NC2-TomsFruitRescue
Tom's Fruit Rescue is a game about a boy who is feeling under the weather on his quest for good health. 

In this tap-and-avoid game, your task is simple yet exciting: tap on the fresh and vibrant fruits that appear on the screen while skillfully avoiding the tempting bad fruits. Every tap on a good fruit brings Tom closer to recovery, while tapping a bad fruit will set him back. Be careful, though, because three or more bad fruit taps will lead to a game over.
